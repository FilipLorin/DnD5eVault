_You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right._

**Skill Proficiencies:** [[Insight]], [[Persuasion]]  
**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of [[artisan's tools]] 
**Languages:** One of your choice  
**Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveller's clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

>[!Note]  Variant - Guild Merchant
> Instead of an artisans' guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from travelling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the travelling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.

> Rather than proficiency with artisan's tools, you might be proficient with navigator's tools or an additional language. And instead of artisan's tools, you can start with a mule and a cart.
