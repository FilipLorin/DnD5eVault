**_Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more._**

_You must have an #Intelligence score of 13 or higher in order to [[multiclass]] in or out of this class._
