Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and [[shortsword|shortswords]]. Whenever you finish a short or [[long rest]], you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
- The weapon must be a simple or [[martial weapons|martial weapon]].
- You must be [[proficiency|proficient]] with it.
- It must lack the [[heavy]] and [[special]] properties.
