At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison – a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 #poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
