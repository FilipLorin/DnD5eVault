Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become [[invisible]] for 1 minute. During that time, you also have [[resistance]] to all damage but #force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the [[Astral Projection]] spell, without needing [[spell components|material components]]. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.
