At 1st level, choose two of your skill [[proficiency|proficiencies]], or one of your skill [[proficiency|proficiencies]] and your [[proficiency]] with [[thieves' tools]]. Your [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] is doubled for any [[ability check]] you make that uses either of the chosen [[proficiency|proficiencies]].

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your [[proficiency|proficiencies]] (in skills or with [[thieves' tools]]) to gain this benefit.
