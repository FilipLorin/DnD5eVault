### Fighting Style
Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

- **Blessed Warrior.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [cleric spell list](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric). They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the [cleric spell list](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric).

- **Blind Fighting.** You have [[blindsight]] with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [[blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

- **Defense.** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

- **Dueling.** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

- **Great Weapon Fighting.** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

- **Interception.** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a [[shields|shield]] or a simple or [[martial weapons|martial weapon]] to use this reaction.

- **Protection.** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose [[disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You must be wielding a [[shields|shield]].
