## Fighting Style - Fighter
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
- **Archery (PHB).** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
- **Blind Fighting (TCE).** You have [[blindsight]] with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [[blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
- **Defense (PHB).** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [[AC]].
- **Dueling (PHB).** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
- **Great Weapon Fighting (PHB).** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the [[two-handed]] or [[versatile]] property for you to gain this benefit.
- **Interception (TCE).** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a [[shields|shield]] or a simple or [[martial weapons|martial weapon]] to use this reaction.
- **Protection (PHB).** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose [[disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You must be wielding a [[shields|shield]].
- **Superior Technique (TCE).** You learn one [[Maneuvers|maneuver]] of your choice from among those available to the [Battle Master](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master) archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a [[saving throw]] to resist the maneuver's effects, the [[saving throw]] [[DC]] equals 8 + your [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] + your #Strength or #Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
    - You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or [[long rest]].
- **Thrown Weapon Fighting (TCE).** You can draw a weapon that has the [[thrown]] property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
    - In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a [[thrown]] weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting (PHB).** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
- **Unarmed Fighting (TCE).** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a [[shields|shield]] when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
    - At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
