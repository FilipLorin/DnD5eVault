## Harness Divine Power (Optional) - Paladin
Also at 3rd level, you can expend a use of your [[Channel Divinity]] to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
