At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you make a [[Insight]] check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's [[Deception]] check. If you succeed, you can use your [[Sneak Attack]] against that target even if you don't have advantage on the [[attack roll]], but not if you have [[disadvantage]] on it.

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.
