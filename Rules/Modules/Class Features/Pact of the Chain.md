You learn the [[Find Familiar]] spell and can cast it as a [[ritual]]. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
- When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[imp]], [[pseudodragon]], [[quasit]], or [[sprite]].
- Additionally, when you take the [[attack roll|attack action]], you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its [[reaction]].
