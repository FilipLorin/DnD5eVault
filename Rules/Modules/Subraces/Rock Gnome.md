**_As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your #Constitution score increases by 1.

- **Artificer's Lore.** Whenever you make an [[History]] [[skill check|check]] related to magical, alchemical, or technological items, you can add twice your [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] instead of any other [[proficiency|proficiency bonus]] that may apply.

- **Tinker.** You have [[proficiency]] with artisan tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:
    - _**Clockwork Toy.**_ This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
    - _**Fire Starter.**_ The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.
    - _**Music Box.**_ When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
    - At your DM's discretion, you may make other objects with effects similar in power to these. The [[Prestidigitation]] cantrip is a good baseline for such effects.
